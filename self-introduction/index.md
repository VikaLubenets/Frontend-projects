Hello everyone and welcome to my first self-introduction video. 

My name is Victoria, I'm 25 years old, and originally I'm from Russia, from a very small town called Azov near Rostov-on-Don. 

However, for the past six years, I have been living in Moscow.

So let's dive into my educational background. First of all, I have a Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Law. I graduated from the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, and for the last six years, I have worked as an international project lawyer in Russian corporations. 

I really loved my job, but last year I faced quite a tough burnout. At that time, I thought my job as useless, thinking that I did not bring any value to the company. It was really tough also to witness how even Russian private law became more political than focused on real law. 

Of course, the belief that my job was entirely useless is not true at all, but that's how I felt. So, I made the decision to quit, even though I received a promotion, and started thinking about what I'd like to do next. 

And here I am. I decided to change my career track, and now my husband and I live in Tbilisi, Georgia. We want to become remote workers and explore the world to decide where we want to settle down.

I delved into programming in February of this year. I tried different courses on the Coursera platform, and programming truly fascinated me. 

Now, I have a passion for it and really enjoy the educational process. I'm incredibly grateful to RS School for providing such a brilliant opportunity for all of us to start a new career. I joined this program in the last two weeks of Stage 0 and then progressed to Stage 1. It was not easy at all, transitioning from a legal background to programming, but I genuinely enjoy it.

And I can see the results. In the legal field, the outcomes of your work are not always obvious since the focus is on risk prevention and mitigation rather than solving tangible problems. However, in programming, it's the opposite. While you still need to prevent coding errors, you also get to create a product, which is what I really want to do next.

Therefore, my goal is to find a job as a front-end developer by the end of the year. 

Currently, I'm working on my pet project, which is connected with learning languages. Three months ago, I started my Spanish learning journey, and I've developed a deep love for the language. It's incredibly beautiful. However, I realized that there aren't many online resources available for learning Spanish. So, I decided to change that and now I'm working on creating Spanish learning materials to add to my web application.

Hopefully, by the end of this phase of work, I will be able to start coding using React and bring my pet project to life. 

I hope you enjoyed this video, and thank you for your attention, your time, and good luck with your training.
