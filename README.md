## Project 3: 'CSS Selectors Game'

**Overview:**
In this project, I have created a CSS selectors trainer. This trainer comprises multiple gaming levels, each with a layout example and HTML code corresponding to that level. Some layout elements are highlighted using animations. The user's task is to write CSS selectors that target all the highlighted layout elements.

**Project Details:**

- **Deployment:** [Link to Deployment](https://vikalubenets.github.io/frontend-projects/RSS-CSS-Selectors/)

- **Code Repository:** [Link to Code](https://github.com/VikaLubenets/frontend-projects/tree/RSS-CSS-Selectors)

**Project Structure**

1. Layout Example: This represents a space with planets, comets and stars.
2. User Input Area: A space for users to input their CSS selectors.
3. HTML Code: Hovering over a code fragment highlights the corresponding layout element, and hovering over a layout element highlights the corresponding code fragment. HTML code for each element is displayed nearby.
4. Game Level List: 15 levels implemented.

**Key Skills:**
1. Typescript
2. Modules
3. Webpack
4. Jest
5. Eslint

**How the App Works:**
- Users can type and submit a CSS selector in the input area that targets all the animated layout elements. They can submit the code by clicking the "Enter" button in the input area or by pressing the "Enter" key on the keyboard.
- Correct and incorrect answers trigger corresponding animations. 
- Upon a correct answer, users move on to the next game level.
- The app includes a "Help" button for users who can't guess the correct selector. Clicking the "Help" button displays the correct selector in the input area with a typing effect (text appearing letter by letter).
- In the game level list, users can navigate to specific levels by clicking their numbers. Each level shows whether it's completed, not completed, or completed with hints. The current level is highlighted. The app remembers the current level even after a page reload. There's also a button to reset progress and start the game from scratch.

## Project 2: 'Minesweeper'

**Overview:**
This is my implementation of the classic game Minesweeper. In this game, players explore a grid of cells, some of which may contain hidden mines. The objective is to reveal all cells that do not contain mines while avoiding clicking on any mined cell.

**Project Details:**

- **Deployment:** [Link to Deployment](https://vikalubenets.github.io/frontend-projects/minesweeper/src/index.html)

- **Code Repository:** [Link to Code](https://github.com/VikaLubenets/frontend-projects/tree/minesweeper)

**Game Rules:**
- The game board consists of cells that can be in one of three states: unopened, opened, or flagged.
- An unopened cell is clickable, while an opened cell is exposed.
- Flagged cells are used to mark potential mine locations.
- Players click on cells to reveal them. If a mined cell is opened, the game ends in a loss.
- Opened cells display either a number, indicating nearby mines, or a blank tile.
- Players can flag cells to indicate suspected mine locations by clicking on right mouse button.

**Main Functional Requirements**

**Basic:**
- The HTML `index.html` file initially contains only an empty body (with only a script tag allowed), and all necessary elements are generated using JavaScript.
- The game design is adaptive (or responsive) for a width of 500px and above.
- The default game board size is 10x10 with 10 mines.
- Players can click on cells to reveal them. Mines end the game (loss), and numbers indicate adjacent mines.
- The game ends when all non-mined cells are revealed (win) or a mine is clicked (loss), with appropriate messages displayed.

**Advanced:**
- Players can flag cells to mark suspected mine locations.
- Color coding (using numbers and colors) indicates the number of surrounding mines.
- The game can be restarted without reloading the page (e.g., a "New game" button).
- Display game duration in seconds and the number of clicks.
- Empty squares open adjacent squares until reaching numbered squares.

**Additional:**
- Implement sound effects for game events (e.g., revealing a cell, flagging a cell, game over).
- Offer difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that adjust the game board size and mine count.
- Support dark/light themes for the game.

## Project 1: 'Shelter'

**Overview:**
"Shelter" is a responsive and interactive website project, consisting of a main page and a pets page, designed for an animal shelter.

**Key Skills:**
1. Valid semantic responsive web development.
2. Maintainable and readable code.
3. Importing styles and graphics from Figma.
4. JavaScript for adding functionality.

**Project Details:**

- **Figma Design:** [Link to Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/Yk6EnbY63FyG2PJTFkJDMh/shelter?type=design&node-id=94-43&mode=design&t=X5A0JFH7cDla0GTh-0)

**Work Summary:**
The project involved creating a responsive and interactive website for an animal shelter. This included valid and semantic web development, importing styles and graphics from Figma, and adding interactivity using JavaScript. The website consists of a main page and a pets page, providing information about animals and ensuring a user-friendly experience on various devices.
